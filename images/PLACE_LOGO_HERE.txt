# 📌 IMPORTANT: ADD YOUR LOGO

## How to Add Your Logo to the Website

Your logo image needs to be placed in the `images` folder.

### Steps:

1. **Save your logo image** (the circular one with ياسر البصري calligraphy)
   
2. **Name it exactly:** `logo.png`

3. **Place it in:** `C:\sheikh-yassir-website\images\logo.png`

### Image Specifications:

- **Format:** PNG with transparent background (recommended)
- **Size:** 200x200 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)
- **Shape:** Circular design works best
- **Quality:** High resolution for crisp display

### Your Logo Design:
- Circular Islamic geometric pattern ✓
- Arabic calligraphy: ياسر البصري ✓
- Gold/beige calligraphy (#c9a961) ✓
- Deep green/teal patterns (#1a5f5a) ✓
- Dark background ✓

Once you place the `logo.png` file in the images folder, refresh your browser and you'll see it appear in:
- Top navigation bar (all pages)
- Footer (all pages)

The logo is already configured to display as a 70x70px circle in the navbar and will look great!
